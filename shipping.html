        <p>We know that Goodie Bags Can NOT be late for the party, and understanding the  shipping timeframe is crucial for our customers.  Instead of the standard shipping page, we have beefed this section up to better explain what you REALLY want to know:  When will I have my goodie bags?  Our hope is to explain shipping without bogging down in the details, but giving enough info for you to make the best and most economical decision.</p>
        <br><p>Please use your CELL PHONE for the Phone Number on the Order form so we can contact you ASAP if we need to. </p>
        <p>Here are the facts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Orders ship next business day.  (Bulk orders are not included in this timeframe)
            <br>Your tracking number will be emailed w/ expected delivery date the day after the party favors are shipped.
            <ul>
              <li>Business days are M-F (except major holidays)</li>
              <li>If you order over the weekend, the order will be shipped on Monday (unless of course Monday is a major holiday -- like 4th of July).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Here is an example if your ground shipping timeframe is 3 days:  If the order is placed on Monday, then your shipping days are Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (delivery should be on Friday).
            <ul>
              <li>SEE section in BLUE for details on GROUND Continental USA Shipping timeframes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Express Saver is 3 shipping days 99% of the time (use the above example of how 3 shipping days play out in the FedEx world).  So, if you are in California and order on Monday with Express Saver, your goodie bags should arrive on Friday. Fyi - if you order on Wednesday w/ Express saver, the box will arrive on Tuesday.</li>
          <li>Shipping charges are added to the total price of the party favors.</li>
          <li>NO PO BOXES - unless a military APO/FPO Box</li>
          <li>GROUND AND EXPRESS CHARGES ARE REFLECTED FOR CONTINENTAL USA ORDERS ONLY.  INTERNATIONAL & non-contienental USA SHIPMENTS AVAILABLE - Email or call for details.
          <br>Also- if you have questions - just call us.  Shoppe hours are usually 9 - 5 M-F daily.  Leave mssg & we will call you back.
          </li>
          <li>**DELAY IN SHIPPING NOTIFICATIONS ARE POSTED: If there is going to be a delay in shipping, it will be posted on the front page of the website. This is very rare, but happens about 2-3 times a year.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Below is the Ground Fedex Map:</p>
