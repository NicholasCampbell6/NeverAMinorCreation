Our website is for a business that provides pre-made goodie bags for different events.
Our website consists of 6 pages: a homepage, Pre-made Bags, Build-A-Bag, Wholesale Bags, FAQ, and a Shipping policy page.
Our homepage has a business statement of what the business does and then a table that tells what each section of products contains with a picture of a product and a button linking to that page.
Under the statement and table, there is a gallery with featured items. The first three items are featured items from the premade bag section while the last 3 are from the wholesale bag section.
The Pre-made Bag page and the Wholesale Bag page are almost identical in layout but consist of different items so we worked on the premade bag page first which made the wholesale bag page very easy.
The build-a-bag section was probably the hardest to make out all of the pages. It took about two weeks of working on it strait before we saw even a little be of it functioning correctly. The amount of time that was spent on this page took away from the rest of the site's styling but we think it was worth it because of how the Build-A-Bag page turned out.
We knew going into the project that we needed to make it responsive before we turned it in so we tried to make it responsive as we went by avoiding the use of px when styling and stuck with percentages and ems for a majority of the site. It worked out well and for the most part, the page was responsive on its own and didn't need many changes.
We both learned a lot from this project. If we had the chance, we could make the site even better because we know how to fix the problems that we faced early on.
We struggled a lot with making images and text to appear in the position we wanted them to be in but we've ended up making several different solutions for positioning text and images.
Overall, this project has helped us both grow in our problem solving skills and will be beneficial to us later in life.
